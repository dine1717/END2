1.What is a neural network neuron?


Neurons are nothing but set of inputs,set of weights and set of activation functions. These neuron  transalates theses inouts to a single output and then it can be picked up as input for another layer.


2.What is the use of the learning rate?

Learning is a configurable hypyerparameter used in the training of teh neural network with value range of 0 to 1.


3.How are weights initialized?

We almost always initialize all the weights in the model to values drawn randomly from a Gaussian or uniform distribution. The choice of Gaussian or uniform distribution does not seem to matter very much, but has not been exhaustively studied. The scale of the initial distribution, however, does have a large effect on both the outcome of the optimization procedure and on the ability of the network to generalize.


4.What is "loss" in a neural network?

loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. That is, loss is a number indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater.

5.What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow? 

The vector chain rule is the general form as it degenerates to the others. When f is a function of a single variable x and all intermediate variables u are functions of a single variable, the single-variable chain rule applies. When some or all of the intermediate variables are functions of multiple variables, the single-variable total-derivative chain rule applies. In all the other cases, the vector chain rule applies.
